Currently installing controllers needs to be done by hand via vJoyConfig.

Using :
Axes
	X, Y for Analog stick
	Rx, Ry for C-stick
	Slider, Slider2 for Left and Right shoulder, respectively.
Buttons
	12

The software uses vjoy devices 1 through 4.

The USB driver for the adapter also needs to be replaced using something like zadig in order to allow for access via libusb.
